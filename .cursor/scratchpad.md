# GetItDone App - Demo Version Creation

## Background and Motivation

**NEW REQUEST**: Create a demo version of the GetItDone app for showcasing and testing purposes.

**Current State**: 
- Main production app deployed at `https://shift6-buildout.onrender.com`
- Next.js PWA with AI task management functionality
- Ready for custom domain setup at `shift6.dwings.app`
- All core functionality working (AI parsing, Google Sheets integration, PWA features)

**Demo Version Goals**:
1. **Showcase Version**: Safe environment for demonstrations without affecting production data
2. **Testing Ground**: Place to test new features before merging to production
3. **User Onboarding**: Simplified version for new users to try the app
4. **Marketing Tool**: Clean, polished version for potential users/investors

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Demo Version Considerations
1. **Data Isolation**: Demo should use separate Google Sheets/webhook to avoid contaminating production data
2. **Environment Separation**: Separate deployment and environment variables
3. **User Experience**: May need simplified onboarding or pre-populated sample data
4. **Branding**: Consider "Demo" labeling to avoid confusion with production
5. **Feature Scope**: Decide which features to include/exclude in demo
6. **Reset Mechanism**: Way to clear demo data periodically

### Technical Approach Options
1. **Git Branch Strategy**: 
   - ✅ Create `demo` branch from `main`
   - ✅ Allows independent development and deployment
   - ✅ Can merge improvements back to main
   - ✅ Separate deployment pipeline

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   - ✅ Separate `.env` files for demo vs production
   - ✅ Different Google Sheets webhook URL
   - ✅ Demo-specific branding/messaging

3. **Deployment Strategy**:
   - ✅ Deploy to separate Render service (e.g., `demo-shift6-buildout.onrender.com`)
   - ✅ Could use subdomain like `demo.dwings.app`

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Demo Branch Setup (Simplified)
- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Create demo branch from main
  - Success: `demo` branch created, switched to demo branch
  - All existing functionality preserved exactly as-is
  
- [ ] **Task 1.2**: Configure separate demo environment
  - Success: Separate Google Sheets webhook for demo data isolation
  - Demo-specific `.env.local` configuration
  - No functional changes to the app itself

### Phase 2: Demo Deployment
- [ ] **Task 2.1**: Deploy demo to separate Render service
  - Success: Demo deployed to separate URL (e.g., `demo-shift6-buildout.onrender.com`)
  - Independent of production deployment
  - Identical functionality, separate data

- [ ] **Task 2.2**: Test demo deployment
  - Success: All functionality works exactly like production
  - Demo data goes to separate Google Sheet
  - No interference with production data

**Current Phase**: Planning Demo Version Creation
**Current Role**: Planner
**Next Action**: Await user approval to proceed with demo branch creation

### 📋 **Recommended Approach:**

**Git Branch Strategy** is the best approach because:
1. **Clean Separation**: Demo and production remain completely separate
2. **Easy Deployment**: Can deploy demo branch to separate Render service
3. **Feature Testing**: New features can be tested in demo before production
4. **Merge Flexibility**: Improvements can be merged back to main when ready
5. **Independent Updates**: Demo can be updated without affecting production

### 🎯 **Demo Version Scope:**

**Include (Keep Everything):**
- ✅ All core AI task parsing functionality
- ✅ Google Sheets integration (separate demo sheet/webhook)
- ✅ PWA features (installable, offline)
- ✅ Responsive mobile/desktop UI
- ✅ Exact same functionality as production

**Environment Changes Only:**
- 🔧 Separate Google Sheets webhook URL for demo data isolation
- 🔧 Demo-specific environment variables
- 🔧 Independent deployment configuration

**NO Demo-Specific Features Needed:**
- ❌ No special branding
- ❌ No sample data
- ❌ No reset functionality  
- ❌ No usage tips
- ❌ No call-to-action messaging

  - Success: Demo deployed to separate URL (e.g., `demo-shift6-buildout.onrender.com`)
  - Independent of production deployment
  - Identical functionality, separate data

- [ ] **Task 2.2**: Test demo deployment
  - Success: All functionality works exactly like production
  - Demo data goes to separate Google Sheet
  - No interference with production data

### Demo Version Tasks (Simplified)
- [ ] Task 1.1: Create demo branch from main
- [ ] Task 1.2: Configure separate demo environment  
- [ ] Task 2.1: Deploy demo to separate Render service
- [ ] Task 2.2: Test demo deployment

### Current Production Status
- [x] ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**: Main app deployed and working at `https://shift6-buildout.onrender.com`
- [x] ✅ **PWA FEATURES**: App installable, offline capable, mobile optimized
- [x] ✅ **AI INTEGRATION**: OpenRouter API + Google Sheets working
- [x] ✅ **BUILD FIXES**: All dependency and configuration issues resolved
- [ ] 🔄 **PENDING**: Custom domain setup at `shift6.dwings.app`

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

**Current Phase**: Planning Demo Version Creation
**Current Role**: Planner
**Next Action**: Await user approval to proceed with demo branch creation

### 🎉 **Demo Version Scope:**

**Include (Keep Everything):**
- ✅ All core AI task parsing functionality
- ✅ Google Sheets integration (separate demo sheet/webhook)
- ✅ PWA features (installable, offline)
- ✅ Responsive mobile/desktop UI
- ✅ Exact same functionality as production

**Environment Changes Only:**
- 🔧 Separate Google Sheets webhook URL for demo data isolation
- 🔧 Demo-specific environment variables
- 🔧 Independent deployment configuration

**NO Demo-Specific Features Needed:**
- ❌ No special branding
- ❌ No sample data
- ❌ No reset functionality  
- ❌ No usage tips
- ❌ No call-to-action messaging
